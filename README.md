# TimeFloor

Timefloor is a community created around the idea of decentralizing the concept of time. The aim is to give tangible value to time through different blockchain-based projects.

As Chief Technology Officer, my role was to develop TimeFloor's digital ecosystem, which includes several projects ranging from website development to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) creation.
