# TimeFloor

Timefloor is a community focused on changing how we think about time, making it less centralized. Our mission is to make time more valuable through creative blockchain projects.

As the Technical Lead, my main job was to lead the development of TimeFloor's digital world. This included various projects, from building websites to creating Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

I joined this exciting project of friends of mine in May 2021, but had to step away in June 2022 due to time constraints.
